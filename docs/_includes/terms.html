  <li><span style="font-weight:600">Experiment</span>: One experiment is a single job run on the cluster. A single experiment includes one primary package, one primary dependency, and attempted splices across each version of the splice dependency. Given a successful splice and that we have the right binaries and/or libraries, we can then run predictors. There is no guarantee that the run will finish or not exit without error. We do our best to capture the different kinds of errors, and provide logs for inspection. Each result listed in below corresponds to one experiment.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight:600">Predictor</span>: A predictor is a tool (e.g., libabigail or symbolator) that can generate some number of predictions for binaries and libraries generated by a package install with a particular dependency splice. A predictor can also be running spack tests for the package. For every predictor run, we try to capture output and return values. Every experiment is not guaranteed to have a predictor run. A predictor can only be run given some combination of matched libraries or binaries.</li>
