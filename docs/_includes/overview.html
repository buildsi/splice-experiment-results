Ths is a component of the <a target="_blank" href="https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/build">BUILD SI</a> project where we aim to:

<ol>
<li>develop models of application binary interface compatibility </li>
<li>perform "splices" across binaries and libraries using spack</li>
<li>for each splice, make a prediction with some model (a tool) if the binary will still work </li>
<li>test the actual spliced binary to validate the prediction. </li>
</ol>

For more details about this experiment, see the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/buildsi/splice-experiment">Splice Experiment</a> repository and <a href="https://github.com/buildsi/spliced">spliced</a> that runs the experiments.
